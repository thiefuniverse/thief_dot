* Thief Plan

This repo will grow up with me. It will be a collection of powerful tools, config, triks, snippets or scripts and keep clean.

** current content
*** vim config
*** system alias
*** ssh config
*** emake: a simple and easy tool for building and compileing projects which's not so large.
